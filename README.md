## Quick Setup

Requires Node.js 22.12 or newer and pnpm 10 or newer. The committed `.npmrc` maps the Laioutr scopes to [npm.laioutr.cloud](https://npm.laioutr.cloud).

1. `npm login --registry https://npm.laioutr.cloud` — once per machine; the token goes to your user `~/.npmrc`. See the [Laioutr NPM Guide](https://docs.laioutr.com/cockpit/project-settings/npm).
2. `pnpm install`
3. `pnpm rc:fetch -p <organization slug>/<project slug> -s <project secret key>` — writes `laioutrrc.json` with your project's configuration. Until then, the playground runs on placeholder content from `playground/fixtures/laioutrrc.json`.
   The playground installs every app listed in its `apps`, so add the ones your project uses besides `@laioutr-app/ui`: `pnpm add -D <package>`.
4. `pnpm dev` — starts the playground on http://localhost:3000.

That's it! You can now use My Laioutr App in your [Laioutr Frontend](https://laioutr.com) ✨

You can find a thorough guide on getting started with Laioutr development in our [developer guide](https://docs.laioutr.com/getting-started/next-steps/local-setup).

## Linting and Formatting

We use ESLint and Prettier to lint and format the code. This repository contains opinionated configurations for both tools. You can, of course, replace them with your own configurations.

## Publishing

Releases run through [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) and publish to npmjs.org
with [npm trusted publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers), so CI needs no npm token and
every release carries provenance.

Day to day: run `pnpm changeset` to describe your change and merge it. The release workflow opens a
"chore: release" PR collecting the pending changesets; merging **that** builds and publishes.

### One-time setup per repository

1. **Repository secrets**
   - `NPM_LAIOUTR_TOKEN` — read access to npm.laioutr.cloud, so CI can install `@laioutr-core/*`.
   - `RELEASE_TOKEN` — a fine-grained PAT owned by the org, scoped to this repo, with **Contents:
     read and write** and **Pull requests: read and write**. A PR opened with the default
     `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot trigger workflows, so release PRs would arrive with no CI and could never
     satisfy a required-status rule.

2. **Bootstrap the package on npm.** Trusted publishing is configured on a package that already
   exists, so the very first version has to be published by hand. `publishConfig.provenance` fails
   outside CI — there is no OIDC provider — so disable it for that one publish:

   ```bash
   pnpm prepack
   npm publish --access public --no-provenance
   ```

   A brand-new package can 404 on the registry for a few minutes afterwards. That is replication lag,
   not a failed publish; check again before re-running anything.

3. **Configure the trusted publisher** on the package's npm settings page: GitHub Actions,
   this repository, workflow `release.yml`. Every release after that is tokenless.

### Private publishing

If you want to publish a private package to npm.laioutr.cloud, you need to:

1. Log in with publish access: `npm login --registry https://npm.laioutr.cloud`, then enable **Publish** on the authorize screen. Keep the token in your user `~/.npmrc` — the project's `.npmrc` is committed.
2. Add this line to the root of the `package.json` file: `"publishConfig": { "registry": "https://npm.laioutr.cloud/" }`
3. Make sure your package-name follows the `@laioutr-org/<organization-slug>__<package-name>` format.

After that you can run `pnpm release` to publish the package to npm.laioutr.cloud.

More information for publishing can be found in the [NPM Guide](https://docs.laioutr.com/cockpit/project-settings/npm#publish-an-organization-package).
